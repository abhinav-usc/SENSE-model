# Extracting Sensorimotor Information from Words

This codebase explores the relationship between word embeddings and Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms.
The code analyzes 40,000 phrases across 11 modalities and builds SENSE (Sensorimotor Embeddings Norm Scoring Engine), a model to extract sensorimotor information from any word, revealing how language encodes sensory experiences.

# Pseudoword Creation and Data analysis

This file creates pseudo words to test the SENSE model with and compare to human study data.
